# 1. Introduction

This document provides an implementation guidance for deploying peer to peer (P2P) energy trading
services using the Beckn Protocol ecosystem. Peer to peer energy trading enables energy producers 
(prosumers) to directly sell excess energy to consumers. 

- Utilities enable such decentralized energy exchange in order to encourage local balancing of 
  supply & demand, reduce transmission losses, congestion and promote the green energy. 
- It can boost the demand when the supply is abundent, say during mid-day solar or nightly wind,
  because consumers may find a lower price in a marketplace than the price of importing from utility.
- It could also boost renewable energy supply if producers discover a higher price for it than the utility
  export price.
- It can reduce losses for the grid operator if they are obligated to buy back the surplus energy
  at a fixed rate which could be higher than the spot price, during solar hours. It also unlocks 
  new revenue streams for the grid operator as they have full visibility to and can charge 
  wheeling charges for any peer to peer energy trade happening on their transmission lines.
- Finally, it can increase the cash in-flows for a large prosumer who has accumulated large 
  credit with the utility due to net-metering policies, but cannot redeem it for cash.
- This achieves beneficial outcomes for producer, consumer and the utility (and in turn redces bills 
  for other consumers not participating in the trade.)
- Such P2P trade is virtual (non-binding) in the sense that it is made before the delivery hour and is 
  based on best estimate of load & generation, but the real energy flows may deviate
  from the trade contract. But the incentive of a better revenue by
  adhereing to the contracted energy flows as well as the cost of deviation cited in contract, 
  naturally aligns incentives of consumers & producers to deliver the contracted energy flows.
- Each P2P trade contract references a real or a virtual meter, against which the deviations are measured post-facto.
  Utility may keep track of the sanctioned (maximum allowed) load or generation at each meter and can limit
  the amount of energy trades via a network policy. Physical meters belong to prosumers. 
  Virtual meters may belong to aggregators and have zero power flows during delivery. 
  Such aggregators can establish peer to peer relationship 
  with many producers and consumers and balance pre-delivery supply & demand, since any deviation of net trade
  flow away from zero (real power flowing through virtual meter) will be penalized.

# 2. Scope

* Architecture patterns for peer-to-peer energy marketplace implementation using Beckn Protocol  
* Discovery of energy trading partners.
* Some recommendations for BAPs, BPPs and NFOs on how to map protocol API calls to 
  internal systems (or vice-versa).  
* Session management and billing coordination between Beckn and OCPI protocols

This document does NOT cover:

* Processes for customer onboarding, meter validation and settlement.
* Fraud prevention: e.g. if a producer strikes a deal with two consumers, 
  settlement mechanics should be aware of total commited trade flows at a meter
  and apportion the shortfall against it.
* Cyber-security and best practices to ensure privacy of market participants by 
  guarding of personally identifiable information data.
* Escrow services to cover the cost trade participant reneging or defaulting on payment.

# 3. Intended Audience

* Consumer Application Developers (BAPs).
* Technology Integrators: Building bridges between existing beckn v1 P2P trading infrastructure and new Beckn v2 based marketplaces  
* Business Stakeholders: Understanding technical capabilities and implementation requirements for peer to pee trading strategies  
* Standards Organizations: Evaluating interoperability approaches for future energy trading standards development

# 6. Mechanics of a P2P energy transaction flow

This walkthrough demonstrates a complete P2P energy trading transaction: a consumer purchases 
10 kWh of solar energy from a producer for grid injection delivery. 

**Scenario**: Consumer (BAP: `bap.energy-consumer.com`) buys 10 kWh from Producer (BPP: `bpp.energy-provider.com`) on Oct 4, 2024, 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM. Source meter: `100200300`, Target meter: `98765456`. Transaction ID: `txn-energy-001`.

```

**1. Discover** - Consumer searches for solar energy with JSONPath filters (`sourceType == 'SOLAR'`, `deliveryMode == 'GRID_INJECTION'`, `availableQuantity >= 10.0`).  
Request: [discover-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/discover-request.json) | Response: [discover-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/discover-response.json)  
*Result: Found `energy-resource-solar-001` at $0.15/kWh, 30.5 kWh available*

**2. Select** - Consumer selects item and receives quote breakdown.  
Request: [select-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/select-request.json) | Response: [select-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/select-response.json)  
*Result: Quote $4.00 ($1.50 energy + $2.50 wheeling)*

**3. Init** - Consumer provides meter IDs (`100200300` → `98765456`), time window, and payment details. BPP may cascade to Utility for load verification and wheeling charges.  
Request: [init-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/init-request.json) | Response: [init-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/init-response.json)  
Cascaded Flow: [cascaded-init-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/cascaded-init-request.json) | [cascaded-on-init-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/cascaded-on-init-response.json)  
*Result: Order initialized, contract PENDING*

**4. Confirm** - Consumer confirms order to activate contract.  
Request: [confirm-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/confirm-request.json) | Response: [confirm-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/confirm-response.json)  
*Result: Contract ACTIVE, settlement cycle `settle-2024-10-04-001` created*

**5. Status (In Progress)** - Consumer monitors delivery progress. BPP updates meter readings and telemetry every 15-30 minutes.  
Request: [status-request.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/status-request.json) | Response: [status-response.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/status-response.json)  
*Result: Delivery IN_PROGRESS, 9.8 kWh delivered (98%), real-time telemetry*

**6. Status (Completed)** - Consumer checks final status after delivery completion.  
Response: [status-response-completed.json](../../../../examples/v2/P2P_Trading/status-response-completed.json)  
*Result: Delivery COMPLETED, 10.0 kWh delivered, settlement SETTLED ($4.00)*

**Summary**: Transaction completed in ~8.5 hours. 10.0 kWh delivered. Total cost $4.00. Daily settlement cycle processed.

## 7.6. Implementation Notes

**For BAP Implementers**:
1. **Discovery**: Use JSONPath filters to search by energy attributes (sourceType, deliveryMode, availableQuantity, productionWindow)
2. **Order Management**: Track order state through PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED
3. **Status Polling**: Poll status endpoint every 15-30 minutes during active delivery
4. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where delivery fails or quantities don't match
5. **Settlement**: Monitor settlement cycle status for payment processing

**For BPP Implementers**:
1. **Catalog Management**: Keep catalog updated with available energy and accurate production windows
2. **Meter Readings**: Update meter readings regularly during delivery (every 15-30 minutes)
3. **Telemetry**: Provide real-time telemetry data for monitoring
4. **Settlement**: Calculate settlement amounts based on delivered quantity and pricing model
5. **State Management**: Properly transition contract and delivery statuses

**Common Patterns**:
- **Idempotency**: Use transaction_id consistently across all requests
- **Time Windows**: Validate production windows and trade time windows
- **Meter IDs**: Always use IEEE mRID format (plain numeric ID, not `der://` format)
- **Quantity Validation**: Ensure delivered quantity matches contracted quantity (within tolerance)


### 7.6.1. Key Differences from v1

| Aspect                 | v1 (Layer2)         | v2 (Composable)              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Schema Extension**   | `allOf` in paths    | Composable attribute bundles |
| **Attribute Location** | `Item.attributes.*` | `Item.itemAttributes.*`      |
| **Meter Format**       | `der://meter/{id}`  | IEEE 2030.5 mRID `{id}`      |
| **JSON-LD**            | Not used            | Full JSON-LD support         |
| **Modularity**         | Monolithic          | Modular bundles              |

            }
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**v2 Format** (No intent object - uses JSONPath filters):
```json
{
  "message": {
    "text_search": "solar energy grid injection",
    "filters": {
      "type": "jsonpath",
      "expression": "$[?(@.itemAttributes.sourceType == 'SOLAR' && @.itemAttributes.deliveryMode == 'GRID_INJECTION' && @.itemAttributes.availableQuantity >= 10.0 && @.itemAttributes.productionWindow.start <= '2024-10-04T10:00:00Z' && @.itemAttributes.productionWindow.end >= '2024-10-04T18:00:00Z')]"
    }
  }
}
```

**Changes**:
- ❌ **Removed**: `intent` object is not supported in v2 discover API
- ✅ **Quantity**: v1 `intent.item.quantity.selected.measure.value` → v2 `filters.expression` with `availableQuantity >= 10.0`
- ✅ **Time Range**: v1 `intent.fulfillment.stops[].time.range` → v2 `filters.expression` with `productionWindow.start <= '...' && productionWindow.end >= '...'`
- ✅ **All Parameters**: Expressed via JSONPath filters in v2

# 8. Creating an Open Network for Peer to Peer Energy Trading

To create an open network for energy trading requires all the producers, prosumers and consumers BAPs, BPPs, to be able to discover each other and become part of a common club. This club is manifested in the form of a Registry maintained by an NFO. 

## 8.1. Setting up a Registry

The NP Registry serves as the root of addressability and trust for all network participants. It maintains comprehensive details such as the participant’s globally unique identifier (ID), network address (Beckn API URL), public key, operational domains, and assigned role (e.g., BAP, BPP, CDS). In addition to managing participant registration, authentication, authorization, and permission control, the Registry oversees participant verification, activation, and overall lifecycle management, ensuring that only validated and authorized entities can operate within the network.

![](./assets/registry-arch.png)

You can publish your registries at [DeDi.global](https://publish.dedi.global/).

### 8.1.1. For a Network Participant

#### 8.1.1.1. Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

To get started, any platform that has implemented Beckn Protocol MUST create a globally unique namespace for themselves.   
All NPs (BAPs, BPPs, CDS’es) **MUST** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN to become globally addressable. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of the namespace by verifying the ownership of their domain. Namespace would be at an organisation level. You can put your organisation name as the name of the namespace.

#### 8.1.1.2. Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Once the namespace is claimed, each NP **MUST** create a Beckn NP registry in the namespace to list their subscriber details. While creating the registry, the user **MUST** configure it with the [subscriber schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/7744f2542034db9675901b61b41c8228ea239074/beckn-subscriber-no-refs.schema.json). Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### 8.1.1.3. Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NPs **MUST** publish their subscription details including their ID, network endpoints, public keys, operational domains and assigned roles (BAP, BPP) as records.

*Detailed steps to create namespaces and registries in dedi.global can be found [here](https://github.com/dedi-global/docs/blob/0976607aabc6641d330a3d41a3bd89ab8790ea09/user-guides/namespace%20and%20registry%20creation.md).*

### 8.1.2. Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.

### 8.1.3. For a Network facilitator organization

#### 8.1.3.1. Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

An NFO **MAY** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of that namespace by verifying the ownership of that domain. The NFO name can be set as the name of the namespace. 
*Note: A calibrated roll out of this infrastructure is planned and hence before it is open to the general public NFOs are advised to share their own domain and the domains of their NPs to the Beckn One team so that they can be whitelisted which will allow the NPs to verify the same using TXT records in their DNS.*

#### 8.1.3.2. Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Network facilitators **MAY** create registries under their own namespace using the [subscriber reference schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/b7cf8a47e6531ef22744b43e6305b8d8cc106e7b/beckn-subscriber-reference.schema.json) to point to either whole registries or records created by the NPs in their own namespaces.  Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### 8.1.3.3. Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NFOs **MAY** publish records which act as pointers to either whole registries or records created by the NPs records. The URL field in the record would be the lookup URL for a registry or a record as per DeDi protocol.

Example: For referencing another registry created by an NP, the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details",
  "type": "Registry",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `example-company` is the namespace of the NP, and all records added in the registry is referenced here. 

If only one record in the registry needs to be referenced, then the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details/energy-bap",
  "type": "Record",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `energy-bap` is the name of the record created by the NP in this registry. Only that record is referenced here.

*Detailed steps to create namespaces and registries in dedi.global can be found [here](https://github.com/dedi-global/docs/blob/0976607aabc6641d330a3d41a3bd89ab8790ea09/user-guides/namespace%20and%20registry%20creation.md).*

#### 8.1.3.4. Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.

## 8.2. Setting up the Protocol Endpoints

This section contains instructions to set up and test the protocol stack for transactions. 

### 8.2.1. Installing Beckn ONIX

All NPs SHOULD install the Beckn ONIX adapter to quickly get set up and become Beckn Protocol compliant. Click [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix?tab=readme-ov-file#automated-setup-recommended)) to learn how to set up Beckn ONIX.

### 8.2.2. Configuring Beckn ONIX for Peer to Peer Energy Trading

A detailed Configuration Guide is available [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/blob/main/CONFIG.md). A quick read of key concepts from the link is recommended.

Specifically, please use the following configuration:
1. Configure dediregistry plugin instead of registry plugin. Read more [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/tree/main/pkg/plugin/implementation/dediregistry).
2. Start with using Simplekeymanager plugin during development, read more [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/tree/main/pkg/plugin/implementation/simplekeymanager). For production deployment, you may setup vault.
3. For routing calls to Catalog Discovery Service, refer to routing configuration [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/blob/main/config/local-simple-routing-BAPCaller.yaml).

### 8.2.3. 10.2.3 Performing a test transaction

Step 1 : Download the postman collection, from [here](/testnet/postman-collections/v2/P2P_Trading).

Step 2 : Run API calls

If you are a BAP

1. Configure the collection/environment variables to the newly installed Beckn ONIX adapter URL and other variables in the collection.
2. Select the discover example and hit send
3. You should see the service catalog response

If you are a BPP

1. Configure the collection/environment variables to the newly installed Beckn ONIX adapter URL and other variables in the collection.
2. Select the on_status example and hit send
3. You should see the response in your console

**Key Points**:
- **No Intent Object**: v2 does not support `intent` object in discover requests. All search parameters are expressed via JSONPath filters.
- **Quantity Filter**: Filter by `itemAttributes.availableQuantity >= 10.0` in JSONPath expression
- **Time Range Filter**: Filter by `productionWindow.start` and `productionWindow.end` to match desired trade time window
  - `productionWindow.start <= '2024-10-04T10:00:00Z'` - Energy available from start time or earlier
  - `productionWindow.end >= '2024-10-04T18:00:00Z'` - Energy available until end time or later
- **JSONPath Filters**: Use JSONPath filters to search by `itemAttributes.sourceType`, `itemAttributes.deliveryMode`, `itemAttributes.availableQuantity`, and `itemAttributes.productionWindow`
- **Response**: Includes full Item with EnergyResource attributes and Offer with EnergyTradeOffer attributes

## 9.3. Init Flow

**Purpose**: Initialize order with fulfillment and payment details

**Endpoint**: `POST /init`

**v1 to v2 Mapping**:
- v1 `Order.fulfillments[].stops[].time.range` → v2 `Order.fulfillments[].stops[].time.range` (same structure)
- v1 `Order.fulfillments[].stops[].location.address` (der:// format) → v2 `Order.fulfillments[].stops[].location.address` (IEEE mRID format)
- v1 `Order.attributes.*` → v2 `Order.orderAttributes.*` (path change)

# 10. Field Mapping Reference

## 10.1. v1 to v2 Field Mapping

| v1 Location                 | v2 Location                      | Notes                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `Item.attributes.*`         | `Item.itemAttributes.*`          | Attribute path change |
| `Offer.attributes.*`        | `Offer.offerAttributes.*`        | Attribute path change |
| `Order.attributes.*`        | `Order.orderAttributes.*`        | Attribute path change |
| `Fulfillment.attributes.*`  | `Fulfillment.attributes.*`       | No change             |
| `der://meter/{id}`          | `{id}` (IEEE mRID)               | Format change         |
| `Tag.value` (energy source) | `itemAttributes.sourceType`      | Direct attribute      |
| `Tag.value` (settlement)    | `offerAttributes.settlementType` | Direct attribute      |

## 10.2. Meter ID Format Migration

**v1 Format**: `der://pge.meter/100200300`  
**v2 Format**: `100200300` (IEEE 2030.5 mRID)

**Migration Rule**: Extract the numeric ID from the `der://` URI.

# 11. Integration Patterns

## 11.1. Attaching Attributes to Core Objects

**Item with EnergyResource**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/core/v2/context.jsonld",
  "@type": "beckn:Item",
  "beckn:id": "energy-resource-solar-001",
  "beckn:descriptor": {
    "@type": "beckn:Descriptor",
    "schema:name": "Solar Energy - 30.5 kWh"
  },
  "beckn:itemAttributes": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/EnergyResource/v0.2/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "EnergyResource",
    "sourceType": "SOLAR",
    "deliveryMode": "GRID_INJECTION",
    "meterId": "100200300"
  }
}
```

**Offer with EnergyTradeOffer**:
```json
{
  "@type": "beckn:Offer",
  "beckn:id": "offer-energy-001",
  "beckn:offerAttributes": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/EnergyTradeOffer/v0.2/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "EnergyTradeOffer",
    "pricingModel": "PER_KWH",
    "settlementType": "DAILY"
  }
}
```

**Order with EnergyTradeContract**:
```json
{
  "@type": "beckn:Order",
  "beckn:id": "order-energy-001",
  "beckn:orderAttributes": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/EnergyTradeContract/v0.2/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "EnergyTradeContract",
    "contractStatus": "ACTIVE",
    "sourceMeterId": "100200300",
    "targetMeterId": "98765456"
  }
}
```

**Fulfillment with EnergyTradeDelivery**:
```json
{
  "@type": "beckn:Fulfillment",
  "beckn:id": "fulfillment-energy-001",
  "beckn:attributes": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/EnergyTradeDelivery/v0.2/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "EnergyTradeDelivery",
    "deliveryStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "meterReadings": [...]
  }
}
```

## 11.2. JSON-LD Context Usage

All attribute bundles include `@context` and `@type`:
- `@context`: Points to the context.jsonld file for the attribute bundle
- `@type`: The schema type (EnergyResource, EnergyTradeOffer, etc.)

## 11.3. Discovery Filtering

Use JSONPath filters to search by energy attributes:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "type": "jsonpath",
    "expression": "$[?(@.itemAttributes.sourceType == 'SOLAR' && @.itemAttributes.deliveryMode == 'GRID_INJECTION' && @.itemAttributes.availableQuantity >= 10.0)]"
  }
}
```

---

# 12. Best Practices

## 12.1. Discovery Optimization

- **Index Key Fields**: Index `itemAttributes.sourceType`, `itemAttributes.deliveryMode`, `itemAttributes.meterId`, `itemAttributes.availableQuantity`
- **Use JSONPath Filters**: Leverage JSONPath for complex filtering
- **Minimal Fields**: Return minimal fields in list/search APIs (see profile.json)

## 12.2. Meter ID Handling

- **Use IEEE mRID Format**: Always use plain identifier (e.g., `"100200300"`), not `der://` format
- **PII Treatment**: Treat meter IDs as PII - do not index, redact in logs, encrypt at rest
- **Discovery**: Meter IDs enable meter-based discovery (provider names not required)

## 12.3. Settlement Cycle Management

- **Initialize on Confirm**: Create settlement cycle when order is confirmed
- **Update on Delivery**: Link deliveries to settlement cycles via `settlementCycleId`
- **Status Tracking**: Track settlement cycle status (PENDING → SETTLED → FAILED)
- **Amount Calculation**: Calculate settlement amount based on delivered quantity and pricing

## 12.4. Meter Readings

- **Regular Updates**: Update meter readings during delivery (every 15-30 minutes)
- **Energy Flow Calculation**: Calculate `energyFlow` as difference between readings
- **Source and Target**: Track both source and target meter readings
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Use accurate timestamps (ISO 8601 format)

## 12.5. Telemetry Data

- **Metric Selection**: Include relevant metrics (ENERGY, POWER, VOLTAGE, CURRENT, FREQUENCY)
- **Unit Codes**: Use correct unit codes (KWH, KW, VLT, AMP, HZ)
- **Update Frequency**: Update telemetry every 5-15 minutes during active delivery
- **Data Retention**: Retain telemetry data for billing and audit purposes

## 12.6. Error Handling

- **Validation Errors**: Validate all required fields before processing
- **Meter ID Format**: Validate meter IDs are IEEE mRID format
- **Quantity Validation**: Ensure quantities are within min/max limits
- **Time Window Validation**: Validate production windows and validity windows

# 13. Migration from v1

## 13.1. Key Changes

1. **Attribute Paths**: Change `attributes.*` to `itemAttributes.*`, `offerAttributes.*`, `orderAttributes.*`
2. **Meter Format**: Convert `der://meter/{id}` to `{id}` (IEEE mRID)
3. **Tag Values**: Convert `Tag.value` to direct attribute fields
4. **JSON-LD**: Add `@context` and `@type` to all attribute objects

## 13.2. Migration Checklist

- Update attribute paths (`attributes.*` → `itemAttributes.*`, etc.)
- Convert meter IDs from `der://` format to IEEE mRID
- Replace `Tag.value` with direct attribute fields
- Add JSON-LD context to all attribute objects
- Update discovery filters to use new attribute paths
- Update validation logic for new schema structure
- Test all transaction flows
- Update documentation

## 13.3. Example Migration

**v1 Format**:
```json
{
  "Item": {
    "attributes": {
      "sourceType": "SOLAR",
      "meterId": "der://pge.meter/100200300"
    }
  },
  "Tag": {
    "value": "SOLAR"
  }
}
```

**v2 Format**:
```json
{
  "@type": "beckn:Item",
  "beckn:itemAttributes": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beckn/protocol-specifications-new/refs/heads/draft/schema/EnergyResource/v0.2/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "EnergyResource",
    "sourceType": "SOLAR",
    "meterId": "100200300"
  }
}
```

## 14.3. Inter energy retailer P2P trading 
This is a specific scenario of P2P trading where the participants come under differnet energy retailers and distribution utilities and engages in direct energy trade. Here, nuances of financial settlement, dispute resolution, energy accounting etc will have to be thought through without affecting ease of participation. More information can be found here [Inter-retailer P2P energy trading](https://github.com/Beckn-One/DEG/blob/main/docs/implementation-guides/v2/P2P_Trading/Inter%20energy%20retailer%20P2P%20trading_draft.md)
