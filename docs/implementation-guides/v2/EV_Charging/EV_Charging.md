# 3. Status of This Memo

**This is a draft RFC for implementing EV charging use cases using the Beckn Protocol. It provides implementation guidance for anyone to build interoperable EV charging applications that integrate with each other on a decentralized network while maintaining compatibility with OCPI standards for CPO communication.**

# 4. Abstract

This document proposes a practical way to make EV charging services easier to find and use by applying the Beckn Protocol’s distributed commerce model. Instead of juggling multiple apps and accounts for different charging networks, EV users on any Beckn protocol-enabled consumer platform (a.k.a BAPs) – can discover and book charging services from Beckn protocol-enabled provider platforms (a.k.a BPPs) that have onboarded one or more Charge Point Operators (CPOs).

EV users can discover, compare options, view transparent pricing, and reserve a slot at any eligible charging station owned or operated by CPOs. By standardizing discovery, pricing, and booking, the approach tackles three persistent barriers to EV adoption: charging anxiety, network fragmentation, and payment complexity.

Built on Beckn’s commerce capabilities and aligned with OCPI for technical interoperability, the implementation lets e-Mobility Service Providers (eMSPs) aggregate services from multiple CPOs while delivering a consistent, app-agnostic experience to consumers. 

# 5. Introduction

This document provides an implementation guidance for deploying EV charging services using the Beckn Protocol ecosystem. It specifically addresses how consumer applications can provide unified access to charging infrastructure across multiple Charge Point Operators while maintaining technical compatibility with existing OCPI-based systems.

# 6. Scope

This document covers:

* Architecture patterns for EV charging marketplace implementation using Beckn Protocol  
* Discovery and charging mechanisms for charging EVs across multiple CPOs  
* Some recommendations for BAPs, BPPs and NFOs on how to map protocol API calls to internal systems (or vice-versa).  
* Real-time availability and pricing integration with OCPI-based systems  
* Session management and billing coordination between Beckn and OCPI protocols

This document does NOT cover:

* Detailed OCPI protocol specifications (refer to OCPI 2.2.1 documentation)  
* Physical charging infrastructure requirements and standards  
* Regulatory compliance beyond technical implementation (varies by jurisdiction)  
* Smart grid integration and load management systems

# 7. Intended Audience

* Consumer Application Developers (BAPs): Building EV driver-facing charging applications with unified cross-network access  
* e-Mobility Service Providers (eMSPs/BPPs): Implementing charging service aggregation platforms across multiple CPO networks

# 11. Creating an Open Network for EV Charging

To create an open network for EV charging requires all the EV charging BAPs, BPPs, to be able to discover each other and become part of a common club. This club is manifested in the form of a Registry maintained by an NFO. 

## 11.1. Setting up a Registry

The NP Registry serves as the root of addressability and trust for all network participants. It maintains comprehensive details such as the participant’s globally unique identifier (ID), network address (Beckn API URL), public key, operational domains, and assigned role (e.g., BAP, BPP, CDS). In addition to managing participant registration, authentication, authorization, and permission control, the Registry oversees participant verification, activation, and overall lifecycle management, ensuring that only validated and authorized entities can operate within the network.

![](./assets/registry-arch.png)

You can publish your registries at [DeDi.global](https://publish.dedi.global/).

### 11.1.1. For a Network Participant

#### 11.1.1.1. Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

To get started, any platform that has implemented Beckn Protocol MUST create a globally unique namespace for themselves.   
All NPs (BAPs, BPPs, CDS’es) **MUST** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN to become globally addressable. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of the namespace by verifying the ownership of their domain. Namespace would be at an organisation level. You can put your organisation name as the name of the namespace.

#### 11.1.1.2. Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Once the namespace is claimed, each NP **MUST** create a Beckn NP registry in the namespace to list their subscriber details. While creating the registry, the user **MUST** configure it with the [subscriber schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/7744f2542034db9675901b61b41c8228ea239074/beckn-subscriber-no-refs.schema.json). Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### 11.1.1.3. Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NPs **MUST** publish their subscription details including their ID, network endpoints, public keys, operational domains and assigned roles (BAP, BPP) as records.

*Detailed steps to create namespaces and registries in dedi.global can be found [here](https://github.com/dedi-global/docs/blob/0976607aabc6641d330a3d41a3bd89ab8790ea09/user-guides/namespace%20and%20registry%20creation.md).*

### 11.1.2. Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.

### 11.1.3. For a Network facilitator organization

#### 11.1.3.1. Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

An NFO **MAY** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of that namespace by verifying the ownership of that domain. The NFO name can be set as the name of the namespace. 
*Note: A calibrated roll out of this infrastructure is planned and hence before it is open to the general public NFOs are advised to share their own domain and the domains of their NPs to the Beckn One team so that they can be whitelisted which will allow the NPs to verify the same using TXT records in their DNS.*

#### 11.1.3.2. Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Network facilitators **MAY** create registries under their own namespace using the [subscriber reference schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/b7cf8a47e6531ef22744b43e6305b8d8cc106e7b/beckn-subscriber-reference.schema.json) to point to either whole registries or records created by the NPs in their own namespaces.  Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### 11.1.3.3. Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NFOs **MAY** publish records which act as pointers to either whole registries or records created by the NPs records. The URL field in the record would be the lookup URL for a registry or a record as per DeDi protocol.

Example: For referencing another registry created by an NP, the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details",
  "type": "Registry",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `example-company` is the namespace of the NP, and all records added in the registry is referenced here. 

If only one record in the registry needs to be referenced, then the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details/energy-bap",
  "type": "Record",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `energy-bap` is the name of the record created by the NP in this registry. Only that record is referenced here.

*Detailed steps to create namespaces and registries in dedi.global can be found [here](https://github.com/dedi-global/docs/blob/0976607aabc6641d330a3d41a3bd89ab8790ea09/user-guides/namespace%20and%20registry%20creation.md).*

#### 11.1.3.4. Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.

## 11.2. Setting up the Protocol Endpoints

This section contains instructions to set up and test the protocol stack for EV charging transactions. 

### 11.2.1. Installing Beckn ONIX

All NPs SHOULD install the Beckn ONIX adapter to quickly get set up and become Beckn Protocol compliant. Click [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix?tab=readme-ov-file#automated-setup-recommended)) to learn how to set up Beckn ONIX.

### 11.2.2. Configuring Beckn ONIX for EV Charging Transactions

A detailed Configuration Guide is available [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/blob/main/CONFIG.md). A quick read of key concepts from the link is recommended.

Specifically, for EV Charging, please use the following configuration:
1. Configure dediregistry plugin instead of registry plugin. Read more [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/tree/main/pkg/plugin/implementation/dediregistry).
2. Start with using Simplekeymanager plugin during development, read more [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/tree/main/pkg/plugin/implementation/simplekeymanager). For production deployment, you may setup vault.
3. For routing calls to Catalog Discovery Service, refer to routing configuration [here](https://github.com/Beckn-One/beckn-onix/blob/main/config/local-simple-routing-BAPCaller.yaml).

### 11.2.3. 10.2.3 Performing a test EV charging transaction

Step 1 : Download the postman collection, from [here](/testnet/postman-collections/v2/EV_Charging/).

Step 2 : Run API calls

# 12. Implementing EV Charging Semantics on Beckn Protocol

This section contains recommendations and guidelines on how to implement EV Charging Services on Beckn Protocol enabled networks. To ensure global interoperability between actors of the EV charging network, the semantics of the EV charging industry need to be mapped to the core schema of Beckn Protocol. The below table summarizes key semantic mappings between the EV Charging Domain and Beckn Protocol domain.

## 12.1. Key Assumptions

- **Assumption 1 :** EV charging is treated as a service, not as a physical object.  
- **Assumption 2:** All CPOs have implemented OCPI interfaces 

Each entity in the charging lifecycle — the service, the commercial terms, and the usage instance — maps to a well-defined semantic concept, enabling platforms to exchange information in a standardized, machine-readable way.

## 12.2. Semantic Model

# 13. Example Workflows (EV User’s Perspective)

## 13.1. Example 1 \- Walk-In to a charging station without reservation.

This section covers a walk-in case where users discover the charger using third-party apps, word of mouth, or Beckn API, and then drive to the location, plug in their EV and charge their vehicle. 

### 13.1.1. Consumer User Journey

A 34-year-old sales manager who drives an EV to client meetings. He’s time-bound, cost-conscious, and prefers simple, scan-and-go experiences. Raghav arrives at a large dine-in restaurant for a one-hour client meeting. He notices a charging bay in the parking lot and decides to top up while he’s inside.

**Discovery**: Raghav opens his EV app, taps sScan & Charge, and scans the QR on the charger. The app pulls the charger’s details (connector, power rating, live status, tariff, any active time-bound offer).

**Order**: Raghav selects a 60-minute top-up, reviews session terms (rate, idle fee window, cancellation rules), and confirms. He chooses UPI and authorizes payment (or an authorization hold, as supported). The app returns a booking/transaction ID.

**Fulfilment**: He plugs in and starts the session from the app. Live progress (kWh, ₹ consumed, ETA) is shown while he’s in the meeting. If the bay has a lunch-hour promo, the discounted rate is applied automatically.

**Post-Fulfilment**: At \~60 minutes, the session stops (or notifies him to unplug). He receives a digital invoice and session summary in-app. If anything went wrong (e.g., session interrupted, SOC reaches 100%, etc.), the app reconciles to bill only for energy delivered and issues any adjustment or refund automatically.

Important points of consideration:

1. From a technical standpoint, the walk-in scenario is comparable to booking an instant slot *after* reaching the location. While it may appear different from a user experience perspective, the underlying API calls and system processes remain largely the same as the advance reservation use case, with key differences in timing and availability checks.  
2. The order flow happens while the user is physically present at the charging station. This creates a more compressed transaction timeline where all booking steps occur on-site, making it essential for the system to handle real-time availability updates and quick response times to ensure a smooth user experience.  
3. Real-time availability: The system checks for immediate slot availability instead of future time slots  
4. Instant booking: The entire discovery → select → init → confirm flow happens within minutes at the physical location  
5. Same API endpoints: Uses identical Beckn protocol calls but with compressed timeframes  
6. Immediate fulfillment: The charging session can start immediately after confirmation, rather than waiting for a scheduled time

### 13.1.2. **API Calls and Schema**

Note: The API calls and schema for walk-in charging are identical to the [advance reservation use case](#use-case-2--reservation-of-an-ev-charging-time-slot) with minor differences in timing and availability. Where sections reference Use Case 2, the same API structure, field definitions, and examples apply unless specifically noted otherwise.

#### 13.1.2.1. `action: discover`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Raghav scans QR code on Charging Point Connector using his BAP user app
- Request: Fetching details of a specific Charging Point Connector (EVSE) after reaching site (using its identifier): [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/01_discover/discovery-by-EVSE.json)

</details>

Note: Users can discover the charging station through off-network channels (such as physical signage, word-of-mouth, or third-party apps not integrated with Beckn) and arrive directly at the location to initiate charging. In this scenario:

* The discovery phase is skipped entirely  
* Users proceed directly to the Select API call by scanning QR codes or using location-based identification  
* The charging station must be able to handle direct selection requests without prior search/discovery  
* This represents a more streamlined flow for walk-in customers who have already identified their preferred charging location

EV user stops the charging session: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/14_01_update/ev-charging-session-end-update.json)

#### 13.1.2.18. async `action: on_update` (stop-charging)

- Method: POST 
- Use Case: At \~60 minutes(or upon the EV user request), the session stops (or notifies the EV user to unplug). He receives a digital invoice and session summary in-app. If anything went wrong (e.g., session interrupted, SOC reaches 100%, etc.), the app reconciles to bill only for energy delivered and issues any adjustment or refund automatically.

## 13.2. Use case 2- Reservation of an EV charging time slot.

This section covers advance reservation of a charging slot where users discover and book a charger before driving to the location.

#### 13.2.0.1. Context:

Adam is driving his electric vehicle along the highway when he notices that his battery level is getting low. Using an EV Charging BAP, Adam discovers nearby charging stations that are compatible with his vehicle. The BAP retrieves available slots and charger specifications from the available provider’s BPPs. Adam selects a preferred charger and books a slot through beckn APIs to avoid waiting on arrival.

![][image1]

#### 13.2.0.2. Discovery

##### 13.2.0.2.1. Adam discovers nearby charging services

About **30 minutes before lunch**, Adam opens his EV Charging BAP (powered by a Beckn-enabled discovery network).

He filters for:

1. **DC Fast chargers** within 5 km of her location,  
2. **Connector Type:** CCS2,  
3. **Amenities:** restaurants or cafes,  
4. **Tariff Model:** per kWh.

The app queries multiple charging providers and returns options showing:

1. **ETA** from current location,  
2. **Real-time availability**,  
3. **Tariff per kWh**,  
4. **Active offers** (e.g., lunch-hour discounts).

She compares them and selects **“EcoPower Highway Hub – Mandya Food Court”**.

#### 13.2.0.3. Order (Reservation)

Adam taps **Reserve Slot → 12:45–13:15 PM**.

The app displays the **session terms**:

| Term               | Example                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Tariff             | ₹18 / kWh                |
| Grace period       | 10 min post-session      |
| Idle fee policy    | ₹2/min after grace       |
| Cancellation rules | Free up to 15 min before |
| Payment options    | Hold, Pre-pay, Post-pay  |

They confirm.

The provider returns a **reservation ID and QR code**, plus a **navigation link** to the site.

#### 13.2.0.4. Fulfilment (Session Start & Tracking)

On arrival, Adam scans the charger’s **QR code**.

The backend matches it to her **reservation ID**, verifies her **OTP authorization**, and starts charging.

In-app, he view live telemetry:

1. Energy dispensed (kWh)  
2. Elapsed time (min)  
3. Running cost (₹)  
4. Estimated completion time

He enjoys lunch while the system manages the session.

If she arrives a few minutes late, the charger holds the slot until the **grace period** expires.

#### 13.2.0.5. Post-Fulfilment

Charging auto-stops at her **target energy level (80 %)** or when she manually ends the session.

The system issues a **digital invoice**, updates her **wallet balance**, and prompts for quick feedback:

1. Amenity rating (1–5)  
2. Overall experience (1–5)  
3. Optional text comments.

Satisfied, Adam resumes his trip—arriving in Mysuru with time to spare.

### 13.2.1. **API Calls and Schema**

#### 13.2.1.1. `action: discover`

Consumers can search for EV charging stations with specific criteria including location, connector type, time window, finder fee etc.

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam opens his EV Charging BAP (powered by a Beckn-enabled discovery network). He filters for chargers within 5 km of his location.
- Request:

CPO returns EV Charging Service Catalog Listing: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/02_on_discover/ev-charging-discovery-catalog.json)

Used together, these bring **true semantic meaning** to the payload, allowing any system to interpret the data consistently based on shared schema definitions.

Note: This is just an example catalog. CPOs are encouraged to innovate on various catalog offerings that involve charging services \+ add\_ons, green charging, etc. More such examples will be added to this document in future releases.

This section outlines the catalogs array, returned in on\_discover, containing provider catalogs. Each catalog includes:

1. **@context / @type**: JSON-LD schema references for Catalog.  
2. **beckn:id**: Catalog identifier.  
3. **beckn:descriptor**: Human-readable description (schema:name, beckn:shortDesc, schema:image).  
4. **beckn:providerId**: CPO identifier.  
5. **beckn:items**: List of charge point items, each with:  
   * **@context / @type**: JSON-LD schema references for Item.  
   * **beckn:id**: Charger identifier.  
   * **beckn:descriptor**: Display data (schema:name, optional beckn:shortDesc).  
   * **beckn:category**: Classification (schema:codeValue, schema:name).
   * **beckn:rateable**: Whether ratings apply.  
   * **beckn:rating**: Aggregate rating (beckn:ratingValue, beckn:ratingCount).  
   * **beckn:networkId**: Network tags.  
   * **beckn:provider**: Nested provider summary (beckn:id, beckn:descriptor.schema:name, beckn:shortDesc).  
   * **beckn:itemAttributes**: EV-charging specifics:  
     * **@context / @type**: Schema refs for attributes.  
     * **ev:connectorType** (e.g., CCS2).  
     * **ev:powerType** (AC/DC).  
     * **ev:maxPowerKW** (number).  
     * **beckn:chargingStation.serviceLocation**: Charging Station location (beckn:gps.schema:latitude / schema:longitude, beckn:address).  
     * **ev:providerTags** (e.g., SPOT).  
     * **ev:tariff**: pricing block (schema:price, schema:priceCurrency, ev:pricingUnit).

##### 13.2.1.2.1. Offers as part of the Catalog

While browsing the charging app for a session, Srilekha notices a banner:  
“Limited Time Offer: ₹20 off when you charge above 5 kWh – Valid till Sunday\!”  
User Journey:  
Discovery  
Srilekha searches for a charger.  
The app shows eligible stations with a badge or label indicating the reward:

* “Offer: ₹20 off above 5 kWh”  
* Visible next to charger name or on charger details screen  
* Optional “Know More” link to view:  
  * Offer conditions  
  * Validity window  
  * Eligible locations

Charging session initiation  
Srilekha selects a charger that displays the reward.  
Before starting, she sees a preview:

* Estimated cost based on kWh  
* Reward condition reminder: “Charge ≥5 kWh to get ₹20 off”  
* Final price estimate with and without reward

Charging  
While charging:

* The app shows real-time updates (optional):  
  * Energy delivered  
  * How close he is to hitting the reward threshold  
  * “You will unlock ₹20 off\!” once 5 kWh is crossed

If the session ends before meeting the threshold, app shows:

* “You used 3.2 kWh \- reward not applied”

**Post-charging**  
Aarav receives a receipt or invoice with a clear breakdown:

* Base charge (e.g., ₹60)  
* Reward discount (e.g., – ₹20)  
* Final amount paid (e.g., ₹40)  
* Message: “Thanks for charging with us. You saved ₹20 with this week’s offer\!”

**beckn:offers**: Commercial offers tied to items, each with:

1. **@context / @type**: JSON-LD schema references for Offer.  
2. **beckn:id**: Offer identifier.  
3. **beckn:descriptor.schema:name**: Offer title.  
4. **beckn:provider**: Provider ID of the offer.  
5. **beckn:items**: Item IDs covered by the offer.  
6. **beckn:price**: Price object (currency, value).

Offer schema in the catalog:

1. This object uses **JSON-LD** to express an Offer with semantic meaning, not just structure.  
2. The @context defines the **namespace mappings** (beckn: → Beckn schema) to give each term a globally unique interpretation.  
3. The @type associates this object with the **class definition** beckn:Offer, enabling consistent validation across systems.  
4. Nested entities (like beckn:Descriptor and beckn:Price) maintain **linked relationships**, preserving meaning across the semantic graph.

#### 13.2.1.3. `action: select`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam selects a charging session slot. 
- Request: EV user requests charge worth specific KWH: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/03_select/ev-charging-select.json)

1. **beckn:orderItems:**  
   1. Defines what the buyer has chosen to purchase or book — in this case, the EV charging service.  
   2. Each entry captures the specific charger (pe-charging-01) and quantity requested (2.5 kWh), representing the intended energy consumption for that session.  
2. **Beckn:fulfillment:**  
   1. Describes the *intended charging session details* for scheduling and compatibility checks.  
3. **ev:starttime / ev:endtime:** Proposed charging window chosen by the user or system.  
4. **ev:vehicle:** Includes the buyer’s EV details (make/model) to help the provider validate connector compatibility and charging capability.

#### 13.2.1.4. `action: on_select` 

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam receives an estimated quotation for the selected slot. 
- Request: CPO responds with dynamically calculated quote: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/04_on_select/ev-charging-on-select.json)

1. **beckn:orderItemAttributes:**  
   1. Returned by the BPP to confirm item-specific technical and commercial details.  
   2. It validates that the selected charger (pe-charging-01) supports the requested specifications —connector type (CCS2), power (30 kW), current type (AC), and tariff (₹45 / kWh).  
   3. This ensures that the buyer and provider are aligned before moving to booking.  
2. **Beckn:totals:**  
   1. Contains the computed **estimated price summary** based on the selection.  
   2. It includes total cost and detailed **breakup** of charges such as session cost and service fee.  
   3. This is a **pre-confirmation cost estimate**, enabling the buyer to review pricing before proceeding to init.

Recommendations for BPP:

1. on\_select payload MUST have a quotation with detailed breakup for the selected time slot based on the parameters provided by the user in the select request.

##### 13.2.1.4.1. Surge Pricing

Surge pricing is an uplift applied on top of the base charging tariff during peak conditions (for example, certain hours or high-demand locations).  
User Journey:  
Discovery  
While searching for a charger around 6:15 PM, Srilekha sees a warning icon and note:  
“Peak-hour surge: +20% between 6 PM – 9 PM.”  
The app highlights this surcharge in:

* The station list view (via badge or icon)  
* The charger details page  
* A “Know More” section that explains:  
  * Why the surge is applied  
  * When and where it applies  
  * How the uplift is calculated against the base fare

Session preview  
Before starting, the app shows the full estimated cost with the same components used in the canonical example:

* Base session cost (45 INR/kWh × 2.5 kWh): ₹112.50  
* Surge pricing uplift (20%): ₹20.00  
* Service fee: ₹10.00  
* Overcharge estimation buffer: ₹13.64  
* Promotional discount (15% offer): -₹15.00  
* Buyer finder fee (2.5%): ₹2.81  
* Estimated total: ₹143.95

Mid-session  
While charging (e.g., after 3.4 kWh delivered), the UI keeps a running tally so the user can see how surge pricing is influencing the bill:

* Base energy accrued: ₹67.50 (3.4 kWh of the 45 INR/kWh)  
* Surge uplift (20% of accrued base): ₹13.50  
* Running subtotal so far: ₹81.00 (service fee, buffer, discount, and buyer finder fee are applied at session close)

Post-charging  
When the session completes, Srilekha receives an itemized receipt that matches the quotation components:

* Energy Delivered: 5.0 kWh (bundle)  
* Base session cost: ₹112.50 (45 INR/kWh × 2.5 kWh)  
* Surge pricing uplift (20%): ₹20.00  
* Service fee: ₹10.00  
* Overcharge estimation buffer: ₹13.64  
* Offer discount (15%): -₹15.00  
* Buyer finder fee (2.5%): ₹2.81  
* Total Payable: ₹143.95

Quote Information:

* message.order["beckn:orderValue"].value: Total estimated price for the service (e.g., "143.95" INR after applying offer discount and fees)  
* message.order["beckn:orderValue"].currency: Currency of the total estimated price (e.g., "INR")  
* message.order["beckn:orderValue"].components: Itemized breakdown of the total estimated price reflecting the components below (mirrors the canonical example in section 4.6.3):  
  * title: Description of the charge (e.g., "Base charging session cost", "Surge price (20%)", "Service fee", "Overcharge estimation", "Offer discount (15%)", "Buyer finder fee (2.5%)")  
  * item.id: Identifier of the item the charge applies to (if applicable)  
  * price.value: Value of the individual charge in the breakup (positive for charges, negative for discounts)  
  * price.currency: Currency of the individual charge in the breakup  
  * Breakup typically includes: base charge = 112.50 INR (45 INR/kWh × 2.5 kWh), surge = 20.00 INR, service fee = 10.00 INR, overcharge estimation = 13.64 INR, offer discount = -15.00 INR, and buyer finder fee = 2.81 INR

#### 13.2.1.5. `action: init`

Loyalty Program and Authorization Process:

The system handles two different scenarios for loyalty programs and authorization:

Example Individual Customer Approach:

* User provides their mobile number in the billing details  
* The BPP may check the user's registered mobile number to identify any active loyalty programs attached to it  
* If loyalty programs are found, the BPP can automatically adjust discounts in the quote based on the customer's loyalty status  
* This approach provides seamless discount application without requiring additional user input

Example B2B Fleet Approach:

* B2B deals typically happen offline, where fleet operators and CPOs (Charge Point Operators) establish commercial agreements outside of the Beckn protocol  
* Fleet drivers may choose an option indicating they have a B2B loyalty program  
* The fleet driver could provide an OTP received from the BPP on their registered mobile number  
* The BPP validates the OTP and adjusts the final quote based on the B2B loyalty program benefits  
* This approach ensures fleet-specific pricing and discounts are applied correctly

Note: These are example implementation approaches. Different networks may choose alternative methods for loyalty program integration, such as QR code scanning, app-based authentication, RFID cards, or other identification mechanisms depending on their technical infrastructure and business requirements.

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: The BAP agrees to collect the payment and sends the payload along with its settlement account details for reconciliation.
- Request: The BAP app requests the final quote and payment terms by submitting billing details along with approval from the BPP to collect the payment: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/05_init/ev-charging-bap-payment-init.json)

1. **order.beckn:id:**
   When the BAP collects the payment, it generates the orderId and includes it in the init payload sent to the BPP.
2. **beckn:orderItemAttributes:**  
   Echoes back the confirmed item specifications from the provider, ensuring both BAP and BPP have an agreed reference for pricing, connector type, and charger characteristics at the time of selection.  
2. **beckn:totals:**  
   Represents a computed price summary returned by the BPP after selection, consolidating all applicable charges.  
   1. The **breakup** array itemizes each cost component (e.g., session cost, service fee) to enable transparency in pricing and later reconciliation.

Recommendations for BAP:

1. init payload MUST contain the billing details of the user in addition to the details which were part of the select request.

#### 13.2.1.6. `action: on_init`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: The BAP receives approval for payment collection on the behalf of BPP.
- Request: The CPO confirms acceptance of BAP-led payment collection and shares the BPP’s settlement account details: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/06_on_init/ev-charging-bpp-payment-on-init.json)

  1. **beckn:payment:**  
      Represents the finalized payment details returned by the BPP after the init stage — this confirms how the user can complete payment before order confirmation.  
  2. **beckn:status:**  
      Indicates the current payment state (e.g., Pending, Paid, or Failed). In this stage, Pending means payment is yet to be completed by the buyer.  
  3. **schema:totalPaymentDue:**  
      Reiterates the payable amount in a normalized schema format (MonetaryAmount) for downstream financial or billing systems that rely on schema.org structures.  
  4. **schema:referencesInvoice:**  
      Provides a direct link to the digital invoice generated for the session, useful for record-keeping and regulatory compliance.  
  5. **schema:paymentOptions:**  
      Lists multiple supported payment methods (UPI, Credit Card, Net Banking), each including identifiers or URLs that the buyer can use to complete the transaction.  
      This serves as the buyer-facing set of actionable payment channels.

  Recommendations for BPP:

  1. on\_init payload MUST have the settlement account payment details of the BPP in addition to the details which were part of the on\_select payload.

- Successful Response: In cases where BPP is collecting payment directly using a payment link and the payment terms dictate that the payment needs to be completed PRE-ORDER, once the payment completion event happens at the BPP’s payment gateway, the BPP may send an unsolicited on\_status call to the BAP with payment.status changed to PAID. Once the BAP receives the same they can trigger the confirm API with payment.status as PAID.

However, when the BAP collects the payment, an unsolicited on\_status call is not required.

#### 13.2.1.8. `action: confirm`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam accepts the terms of the order and confirms the order.
- Request: EV user confirms reservation of a slot at a particular charging station at a particular time: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/07_confirm/ev-charging-confirm.json)
  1. **beckn:payment:**  
      Captures the *final* payment record returned after successful transaction confirmation — this confirms the completion of the payment flow.  
  2. **beckn:status:**  
      Set to "Captured", indicating the payment has been successfully received and verified by the provider (i.e., no longer pending or provisional).  
  3. **schema:provider:**  
      Identifies the payment gateway or processor that handled the transaction (e.g., PayTM UPI Gateway). Used for reconciliation and audits.  
  4. **schema:totalPaymentReceived:**  
      Represents the *actual* amount confirmed as received, mirroring the captured transaction amount for accounting consistency.  
  5. **schema:paymentMethod / schema:paymentMethodId:**  
      Specifies the channel (e.g., UPI, card, net banking) and the gateway-side transaction reference for traceability in settlements.  
  6. **schema:confirmationNumber:**  
      A receipt or reference number generated post-payment — shared with both buyer and seller for proof of payment.  
  7. **schema:referencesInvoice:**  
      Links the transaction to its original invoice, ensuring traceability between billing and payment records.

  Recommendations for BAP:

  1. confirm payload MUST have a proof of payment as part of the payment object if the payment is collected by BPP in addition to the details which were part of the init request.

#### 13.2.1.9. `action: on_confirm`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam receives an order ID and QR code, plus a navigation link to the charging site.
- Request: 
  CPO responds with confirmed slot: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/08_00_on_confirm/ev-charging-on-confirm.json)

  **ev:fulfillmentstate:**  
  Represents the *real-time operational state* of the charging session.

  * **ev:name:** Descriptive label for the state (e.g., "Slot booked").  
  * **ev:code:** Machine-readable status (e.g., "BOOKED") used for workflow automation by BAPs/BPPs.

  Recommendations for BPP:

  1. on\_confirm payload MUST have the order id assigned to this order. Payload MUST also have the current fulfilment state of the order.  
  2. These details are in addition to the details which were part of the on\_init payload.

#### 13.2.1.10. `action: update` (start charging)

Physical Charging Process:

Before initiating the charging session through the API, the EV driver must complete the following physical steps at the charging station:

1. Drive to the charging point: The user arrives at the reserved charging location at the scheduled time  
2. Plug the vehicle: Connect the charging cable from the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) to their vehicle's charging port  
3. Provide the OTP: Enter or scan the OTP received during the init process to authenticate and authorize the start of the charging session

Once these physical steps are completed, the charging session can be initiated through the update API call.

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: On arrival, Adam scans the charger’s **QR code**. The backend matches it to her **reservation ID**, verifies her **OTP authorization**, and starts charging.
- Request: EV user starts a charging session: [Example](../../../examples/v2/ev_charging/v2/09_update/ev-charging-01-session-start-update.json)
  **beckn:[fulfillment.ev](http://fulfillment.ev):fulfillmentstate:** Communicates the *real-time operational status* of the charging session.

  * "Charging Active" / code "CHARGING-ACTIVE" indicates that the EV charging session has started and energy delivery is in progress.  
  * This state can evolve (e.g., to "CHARGING-COMPLETED", "STOPPED", etc.) as updates continue from the BPP.

  **Beckn:authorization:** Captures authentication details required before or during session start.

  * **beckn:type:** Specifies the verification method — here "OTP" (One-Time Password).  
  * **beckn:value:** The OTP code generated for session authentication.  
  * **beckn:validUntil:** Expiry time of the OTP; ensures time-bound security at the charging point.  
  * **beckn:verified:** Boolean flag indicating whether the OTP has been validated yet (false means pending verification).  
  * **beckn:purpose:** Human-readable explanation of why this authorization is needed — in this case, to verify the user at the EV station before starting the session.

#### 13.2.1.12. `action: status`

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam initiates a request to track the charging progress of the active charging session.
- Request: EV User tracks a live charging session in real-time: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/11_status/ev-charging-session-track.json)

  **beckn:orderAttributes:**  
  Holds parameters that instruct how the tracking process should operate during an ongoing session.

  1. **beckn:callback-url:** Specifies the endpoint on the BAP side (https://example-bap-url.com/SESSION/5e4f) where the BPP should continuously push live updates — such as charging progress, duration, or status changes — during the tracking session.  
  2. **beckn:track-fulfillment:** Boolean flag indicating whether live fulfillment tracking is enabled (true means the BPP should send periodic state updates to the callback URL).

#### 13.2.1.14. asynchronous `action: on_status` (temporary connection interruption)

1. This is used in case of a connection interruption during a charging session.  
2. Applicable only in case of temporary connection interruptions, BPPs expect to recover from these connection interruptions in the short term.  
3. BPP notifies the BAP about this interruption using an unsolicited on\_status callback.  
4. NOTE: if the issue remains unresolved and BPP expects it to be a long term issue, BPP must send an unsolicited on\_update to the BAP with relevant details.

###### 13.2.1.14.0.1. **A)Undercharge (Power Cut Mid-Session)**

Scenario: The user reserves a 12:45–13:30 slot and prepays ₹500 in the app to the BPP platform. Charging starts on time; the app shows ETA and live ₹/kWh. At 13:05 a power cut stops the charger. The charger loses connectivity and can’t push meter data. The app immediately shows: “Session interrupted—only actual energy will be billed. You may unplug or wait for power to resume.”

Handling & experience:

* User side: Clear banner \+ push notification; live session switches to “Paused (site offline)”. If the user leaves, the session is treated as completed-so-far.  
* CPO/BPP side: When power/comms return, the CMS syncs the actual kWh delivered and stop timestamp.  
* Settlement logic:  
  * If prepaid: compute final ₹ from synced kWh; auto-refund the unused balance to the original instrument; issue invoice.  
  * If auth-hold/UPI mandate (preferred): capture only the final ₹; release remainder instantly.

Contract/UI terms to bake in: “Power/interruption protection: you are charged only for energy delivered; any excess prepayment is automatically refunded on sync.” Show an estimated refund immediately, and a final confirmation after sync.

###### 13.2.1.14.0.2. **B) Overcharge (Charger Offline to CMS; Keeps Dispensing)**

Scenario: The user reserves a slot with ₹500 budget. Charging begins; mid-session the charger loses connectivity to its CMS (e.g., basement, patchy network). Hardware keeps dispensing; when connectivity returns, the log shows ₹520 worth of energy delivered.

Handling & experience:

* User side: The app shows “Connectivity issue at site—session continues locally. The final bill will be reconciled in sync.” On sync, the app shows: “Final: ₹520 for X kWh; ₹30 auto-settled.”  
* CPO/BPP side: Charger syncs start/stop/kWh; CMS reconciles vs. contract.

Settlement logic (three safe patterns):

* Buffer in quote (prepaid with overage provision):  
  * Quote line items include: “Energy (₹500) \+ Overage Provision (₹50) — unused portion auto-refunded.”  
  * BPP collects ₹550; captures actual ₹520; refunds ₹30 immediately on sync.  
* Authorization hold / UPI one-time mandate (preferred):  
  * Place a hold/mandate for ₹550; capture ₹520, release ₹30. No debit-then-refund friction.  
* Top-up debit fallback:  
  * If only ₹500 was captured and no mandate exists, the app auto-initiates a ₹20 top-up request (same instrument), with clear messaging and a single-tap confirmation.

Contract/UI terms to bake in: “Offline continuity & overage: sessions may continue locally during short connectivity loss; final billing reflects meter data. We place a buffer hold to avoid delays; unused amounts are released automatically.”

API Implementation: The above under and overcharge scenarios are supported through Beckn protocol callbacks:

* Interruption notification: BPP informs BAP about any session interruption using unsolicited on\_status callback  
* Final billing adjustment: The adjusted bill reflecting overcharge or undercharge reconciliation is conveyed through the on\_update API quote  
* Real-time status updates: Continuous session monitoring and status communication ensure transparent billing for actual energy delivered

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam receives notification when there is any error during an ongoing charging session.
- Request: EV user reveives details in case of any error during a charging session: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/13_on_status/ev-charging-session-interrupt-on-status.json)

#### 13.2.1.15. Asynchronous `action: on_update` (stop charging)

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Use Cases: Adam receives an update when the charging session ends. This might reflect payment adjustment as per use.
- Request: EV user receives final order details after the charging session ends: [Example](../../../examples/ev_charging/v2/14_02_on_update/ev-charging-sesion-complete-on-update.json)

  1. **ev:fulfillmentstate:**  
    "Charging Completed" / code "CHARGING-COMPLETED" indicates that the charging session has ended successfully and all energy delivery is complete.  
  2. **beckn:totals:**  
    Contains the **final billing summary** returned after charging completion — this section includes the complete cost breakdown for the session (e.g., energy cost and service fee).  
  3. **beckn:payment:**  
    Confirms that the corresponding payment has been successfully captured.  
    Includes transaction identifiers, timestamps, payment provider, and invoice reference for settlement and customer records.

#### 13.2.1.17. `action: cancel`

It’s like when a client calls to cancel an appointment — maybe something came up, or their plans have changed. When they request to cancel, it’s about freeing up that slot and keeping things organized.

**Note:** Users can cancel a reserved charging slot only in accordance with the network or CPO’s cancellation policy. For example, cancellations may only be allowed **at least 3 hours before the scheduled start time**, **only for pre-booked sessions**, or **subject to a small cancellation fee** depending on the operator’s terms.

This API is **NOT** to be used to cancel an ongoing session. To cancel an ongoing session, use the update API.

- Method: POST
- Use Cases: Adam cancels a scheduled charging session.

### 13.2.2. **Integrating with your software**

This section gives a general walkthrough of how you would integrate your software with the Beckn network (say the sandbox environment). Refer to the starter kit for details on how to register with the sandbox and get credentials.

Beckn-ONIX is an initiative to promote easy installation and maintenance of a Beckn Network. Apart from the Registry and Gateway components that are required for a network facilitator, Beckn-ONIX provides a Beckn Adapter. A reference implementation of the Beckn-ONIX specification is available at [Beckn-ONIX repository](https://github.com/beckn/beckn-onix). The reference implementation of the Beckn Adapter is called the Protocol Server. Based on whether we are writing the seeker platform or the provider platform, we will be installing the BAP Protocol Server or the BPP Protocol Server respectively.

#### 13.2.2.1. **Integrating the BAP**

If you are writing the seeker platform software, the following are the steps you can follow to build and integrate your application.

1. Identify the use cases from the above section that are close to the functionality you plan for your application.  
2. Design and develop the UI that implements the flow you need. Typically you will have an API server that this UI talks to and it is called the Seeker Platform in the diagram below.  
3. The API server should construct the required JSON message packets required for the different endpoints shown in the API section above.  
4. Install the BAP Protocol Server using the reference implementation of Beckn-ONIX. During the installation, you will need the address of the registry of the environment, a URL where the Beckn responses will arrive (called Subscriber URL) and a subscriber\_id (typically the same as subscriber URL without the "https://" prefix)  
5. Install the layer 2 file for the domain (Link is in the last section of this document)  
6. Check with your network tech support to enable your BAP Protocol Server in the registry.  
7. Once enabled, you can transact on the Beckn Network. Typically the sandbox environment will have the rest of the components you need to test your software. In the diagram below,  
   * you write the Seeker Platform(dark blue)  
   * install the BAP Protocol Server (light blue)  
   * the remaining components are provided by the sandbox environment  
8. Once the application is working on the Sandbox, refer to the Starter kit for instructions to take it to pre-production and production.

#### 13.2.2.2. **Integrating the BPP**

If you are writing the provider platform software, the following are the steps you can follow to build and integrate your application.

1. Identify the use cases from the above section that are close to the functionality you plan for your application.  
2. Design and develop the component that accepts the Beckn requests and interacts with your software to do transactions. It has to be an endpoint(it is called as webhook\_url in the description below) which receives all the Beckn requests (search, select etc). This endpoint can either exist outside of your marketplace/shop software or within it. That is a design decision that will have to be taken by you based on the design of your existing marketplace/shop software. This component is also responsible for sending back the responses to the Beckn Adaptor.  
3. Install the BPP Protocol Server using the reference implementation of Beckn-ONIX. During the installation, you will need the address of the registry of the environment, a URL where the Beckn responses will arrive (called Subscriber URL), a subscriber\_id (typically the same as subscriber URL without the "https://" prefix) and the webhook\_url that you configured in the step above. Also the address of the BPP Protocol Server Client will have to be configured in your component above. This address hosts all the response endpoints (on\_search,on\_select etc)  
4. Install the layer 2 file for the domain (Link is in the last section of this document)  
5. Check with your network tech support to enable your BPP Protocol Server in the registry.  
6. Once enabled, you can transact on the Beckn Network. Typically the sandbox environment will have the rest of the components you need to test your software. In the diagram below,  
   * you write the Provider Platform(dark blue) \- Here the component you wrote above in point 2 as well as your marketplace/shop software is together shown as Provider Platform  
   * install the BPP Protocol Server (light blue)  
   * the remaining components are provided by the sandbox environment  
   * Use the postman collection to test your Provider Platform  
7. Once the application is working on the Sandbox, refer to the Starter kit for instructions to take it to pre-production and production.
